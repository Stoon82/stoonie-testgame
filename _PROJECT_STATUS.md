# Project Status

## Current State
- The project is in active development with core modules implemented as per the instructions.
- The game features a dynamic ecosystem with interacting entities.
- Successfully implemented terrain system with textured heightmap and proper terrain modification.
- Improved entity movement and map boundary handling.

## Recent Updates
- Fixed terrain mesh appearance and texture application:
  - Implemented proper vertex coordinate handling in MapEditManager
  - Enhanced terrain texture generation with gradients and noise
  - Improved terrain modification tools (raise, lower, smooth)
  - Added proper height variations and smooth transitions
- Enhanced Stoonie and Demon Stoonie movement patterns:
  - Stoonies now utilize more of the available map area
  - Improved fleeing behavior near map boundaries
  - Fixed Demon Stoonie boundary violations
  - Added smooth transitions near map edges
- Implemented proper map bounds checking using WorldManager dimensions

## Known Issues
- No specific bugs have been reported in the current session, but the bug-reports.json file is available for tracking.

## Pending Tasks
- Further testing of terrain modification tools
- Optimization of terrain mesh updates
- Integration of terrain features with entity pathfinding
- Further testing and debugging to ensure stability.
- Potential expansion of game features and mechanics.

## Future Plans
- Enhance the soul system with additional powers and progression mechanics
- Improve AI behaviors for Stoonies and Demon Stoonies
- Expand the world environment and interaction possibilities
- Add more terrain features and environmental elements

## Game Rules

### Stoonie Rules
1. **Gender & Appearance**
   - Males are red spheres
   - Females are blue spheres
   - Both have the same base capabilities

2. **Life Cycle**
   - Energy decreases over time
   - Health affected by demon attacks
   - Death occurs when health or energy reaches 0
   - Death returns soul to pool if connected

3. **Reproduction**
   - Requires one male and one female
   - Both parents must have >50% energy
   - Mating costs 30 energy points
   - New Stoonie inherits traits from parents

### Soul System Rules
1. **Soul Management**
   - Start with 3 souls in pool
   - Souls automatically connect to new Stoonies
   - Souls return to pool when Stoonie dies
   - Each soul levels independently

2. **Experience Gain**
   - Gain XP while pregnant
   - Gain XP for successful mating
   - Experience curves increase with level
   - Powers unlock at specific levels

3. **Soul Powers**
   - Level 2: Speed Boost (50% faster)
   - Level 3: Healing Aura (20% health regen)
   - Level 5: Shield Bubble (50 shield points)
   - Level 7: Energy Blast (unlocked)
   - Level 10: Time Warp (unlocked)

### Game World Rules
1. **Environment**
   - Bounded play area (80x80 units)
   - Entities stay within bounds
   - Smooth physics movement
   - Collision detection between entities

2. **Combat**
   - DemonStoonies actively hunt Stoonies
   - Damage is reduced by shields
   - No friendly fire between Stoonies
   - Visual feedback for damage

### UI Rules
1. **Entity Interaction**
   - Hover over entities to view stats
   - Stats panel follows cursor
   - Different stats for different entities
   - Soul status shown if connected

2. **Soul Overview Panel**
   - Located on the left side of the screen
   - Shows total soul count and status
   - Displays individual soul cards
   - Color-coded for connection status
   - Shows experience progress bars
   - Lists unlocked powers
   - Displays connected Stoonie info

3. **Selection System**
   - Click to select single Stoonie
   - Shift+Click for multi-select
   - Selection ring around selected Stoonies
   - Selection panel shows detailed stats
   - Clear selection by clicking empty space

4. **Debug Mode (Shift Key)**
   - FPS counter
   - Entity population statistics
   - Direction indicators
   - Velocity vectors
   - Interaction radius

## Combat System

### Damage Mechanics
1. **Cooldown System**
   - Entities can only take damage every 0.5 seconds
   - Prevents rapid-fire damage from overwhelming entities
   - Gives Stoonies a chance to escape from demons

2. **Death Handling**
   - Entities are removed from scene 1 second after death
   - Death state prevents further damage
   - Visual feedback during death sequence
   - Proper cleanup of all entity resources

3. **Area Attacks**
   - Demons affect all Stoonies within 8 units
   - Base damage with random variation (Â±20%)
   - Visual feedback during attacks
   - Damage indicators show amount of damage taken

4. **Visual Feedback**
   - Damage numbers appear above damaged entities
   - Selection rings scale with entity size
   - Demons glow red during attacks
   - Death effects visible before cleanup

### Selection System
1. **Selection Rings**
   - Green rings appear around selected entities
   - Ring size scales with entity's bounding sphere
   - Rings float slightly above ground to prevent z-fighting
   - Semi-transparent for better visibility

2. **Multi-Select**
   - Hold Shift to select multiple entities
   - Clear selection by clicking empty space
   - Selected entities show in details panel
   - Selection persists until manually cleared

## UI Components (`frontend/js/ui/`)
- **StatsOverlay.js**
  - Real-time entity information display
  - Shows details for Stoonies, Trees, and Buildings
  - Position tracking for hover placement
  - Context-aware information display
  - Custom styling for each entity type

## Code Standards and Patterns

### Export/Import Standards
- Use default exports for all classes:
```javascript
// Good
export default ClassName;

// Bad
export { ClassName };
```

- Import using default imports:
```javascript
// Good
import ClassName from './ClassName.js';

// Bad
import { ClassName } from './ClassName.js';
```

- Exception: Only use named imports for third-party libraries that require it:
```javascript
import { OrbitControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls';
```

### Class Structure Pattern
Each class should follow this pattern:
```javascript
class ClassName {
    constructor(gameEngine) {
        this.gameEngine = gameEngine;
        this.initialized = false;
        // Other initialization
    }

    initialize() {
        if (this.initialized) return;
        console.log('Initializing ClassName');
        
        // Initialization logic
        
        this.initialized = true;
    }

    update(deltaTime) {
        if (!this.initialized) return;
        // Update logic
    }
}
```

### Manager Class Requirements
- All manager classes should take `gameEngine` as their constructor parameter
- Get required references through gameEngine (e.g., `this.scene = gameEngine.scene`)
- Include initialization tracking with `this.initialized`
- Check initialization state in update methods
- Implement proper cleanup in removeEntity methods
- Use Maps for collections that need frequent lookups

### Error Handling Standards
- Check for null/undefined objects before use
- Use proper initialization checks
- Log meaningful error messages
- Handle edge cases in entity interactions
- Implement proper cleanup on entity removal

### Performance Guidelines
- Use Maps for collections that need frequent lookups
- Check initialization state before updates
- Use efficient data structures for spatial queries
- Implement proper cleanup in removeEntity methods
- Update UI elements only when necessary
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
